	For Assignment 6, bubble sort and insertion sort were utilized to sort an array of integers.  For both algorithms, the worst-case scenario occurs
when the array is sorted in reverse.  Since both algorithms utilize a double loop, the time complexity for this worst-case scenario is O(n^2).  Thus,
neither bubble nor insertion sort are efficient for large arrays; many other algorithms have better complexities in the worst case.  In the best case, the 
array is already sorted, which yields a time complexity of O(n) for both algorithms.  
	Although both bubble and insertion sort have the same best- and worst-case time complexities, they won't always yield the same results.  Insertion
sort is generally more efficient, especially for arrays that are mostly sorted. For each pass, it places an element in its correct position in the sorted section.  In 
comparison, bubble sort bubbles the minima (or maxima for ascending order) out of the unsorted section one swap at a time, resulting in more total actions, 
and therefore, time.
