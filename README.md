# Sorting_Algorithms
This program (C++) allows the user to read in a list of unsorted integers from a text file and select either insertion sort or bubble sort to sort the list in descending order. bb_java is a Java version. bb_quickSort is a version that adds quick sort and randomly selects which of the three sorting methods is used to sort the list.
